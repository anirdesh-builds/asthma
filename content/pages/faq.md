# FAQ

We've spent a lot of time understanding how people manage chronic conditions like asthma. At first, we wanted to make sure patients had access to the right medical information and support when they needed it most. We found that managing asthma can be overwhelming, and we wanted to make it easier for others.

Then, as we started designing Asthma Coach, we identified the tension between wanting to stay on top of your health and feeling overwhelmed by all the things you need to track. It's a widespread problem that affects the wellbeing of millions with asthma in the U.S. We believe there's a way to manage asthma effectively while feeling empowered and supported. And as technologists and healthcare professionals, we feel we have a responsibility to help design a way forward.

After extensive research and development, our testing showed users feeling significantly more confident and in control of their asthma management after using the app.
